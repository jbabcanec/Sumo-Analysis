\section{Origins and Evolution}

Professional sumo wrestling (\japterm{ōzumō}{ozumo}) represents one of the world's oldest continuously practiced sports, with roots extending back over 1,500 years. What began as Shinto harvest rituals evolved through centuries into today's highly structured professional sport, maintaining ceremonial elements while adapting to modern athletic and commercial demands.

The sport's documented history begins in the Nara period (710--794), though archaeological evidence suggests proto-sumo existed centuries earlier. The Nihon Shoki, Japan's second-oldest book of classical history, records a wrestling match in 23 BCE between Nomi no Sukune and Taima no Kuehaya---often cited as sumo's mythological origin.
