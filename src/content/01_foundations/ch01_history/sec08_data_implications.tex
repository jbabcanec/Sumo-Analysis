\section{Data Implications}

These historical and structural elements create several analytical considerations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Era effects}: Performance metrics must account for rule changes, tournament frequency, and competitive density
\item \textbf{Selection bias}: Foreign wrestler quota creates non-random selection into stables
\item \textbf{Censoring}: Injury absence patterns changed fundamentally in 2003
\item \textbf{Network effects}: Same-stable exclusion creates missing data patterns
\item \textbf{Incentive discontinuities}: Promotion thresholds create non-linear effort incentives
\end{enumerate}

Understanding this historical context is essential for interpreting the statistical patterns we uncover in subsequent chapters. The sport's unique blend of ancient tradition and modern athletics creates a rich but complex data environment requiring careful analytical treatment.
