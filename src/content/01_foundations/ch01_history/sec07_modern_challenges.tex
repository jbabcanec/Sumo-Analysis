\section{Modern Era Challenges}

Contemporary sumo faces several pressures affecting our data:

\paragraph{Recruitment Crisis}
New wrestler numbers have declined 40\% since 1990, concentrating talent and potentially affecting competitive dynamics.

\paragraph{Internationalization}
Foreign-born wrestlers now dominate upper ranks despite quotas:
\begin{itemize}
\item 67 of 72 yokozuna championships (2004--2024) won by Mongolian wrestlers
\item Increasing technical diversity from international styles
\item Stable recruitment strategies adapted to one-foreign rule
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Match-Fixing Scandals}
2011 revelations led to tournament cancellation and 23 forced retirements, creating a structural break in our time series and natural experiment for integrity analysis.

\paragraph{Health and Safety Evolution}
Increased medical oversight and concussion protocols since 2018 affect injury reporting and potentially bout outcomes.
