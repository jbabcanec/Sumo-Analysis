\section{Key Rule Changes Affecting Statistical Analysis}

Several policy changes create natural experiments for analysis:

\paragraph{1958: Six-Tournament System}
Standardized annual schedule enabling consistent performance metrics and career progression patterns.

\paragraph{1972: Makushita Tsukedashi}
Allowed accomplished amateur wrestlers to enter at Makushita 15 or 10, bypassing lower divisions. This created a distinct cohort with different career trajectories.

\paragraph{2003: Abolition of Kōshō System}
Eliminated injury protection that allowed wrestlers to maintain rank while absent. This fundamentally altered injury incentives and risk-taking behavior:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pre-2003: Injured wrestlers could sit out with rank protection
\item Post-2003: Any absence results in automatic demotion
\item Created measurable changes in injury patterns and career longevity
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{2010: Foreign Wrestler Definition Clarification}
Refined rules for naturalized citizens and their stable eligibility, affecting recruitment patterns and competitive balance.
